# MachineLearningwithGraphs

This is a school project titled:
Deep Learning vs Traditional Community Detection on Twitch Accounts

We downloaded two datasets from online:
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch_gamers.html (in a folder called twitch_gamers)
https://snap.stanford.edu/data/twitch-social-networks.html (in a folder called twitch)

in the twitch folder there are also GraRep embeddings that we made using this Github Repo: https://github.com/benedekrozemberczki/GraRep
Those are titled xxxxxx_grarep.csv
We followed the steps in that readme and got those files

The text file named: project_requirements.txt
is the packages I used (using anaconda) to run my files using python 3.8.15

The folder titled: With_Output
means that is the files we ran that still has the output that we will use in the paper/presentation 

GNNS.ipynb
is a modified file from: https://github.com/Alexander-Belyi/GNNS
this is ran in google colab. please also make sure you have the right file structure in google drive to access the needed files to run the program
